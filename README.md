**Project: NS3 Python Simulation with Mobility and QoS Testing**

## Overview
This project aims to create a simulation environment using NS3 (Python) with a focus on mobility and Quality of Service (QoS) testing. NS3 is a discrete-event network simulator primarily used for research and educational purposes. By leveraging its Python bindings, we intend to construct a flexible and efficient simulation framework capable of emulating various network scenarios with dynamic node mobility and assessing QoS metrics.

## Features
- **NS3 Simulation:** Utilizes NS3, a widely-used network simulator, to model network behavior accurately.
- **Python Integration:** Leverages NS3's Python bindings to enhance ease of use and flexibility in simulation setup and configuration.
- **Mobility Modeling:** Incorporates dynamic mobility patterns for network nodes, allowing realistic movement scenarios.
- **QoS Testing:** Focuses on evaluating Quality of Service metrics such as throughput, latency, jitter, and packet loss under different network conditions.
- **Scenario Customization:** Provides the ability to customize simulation scenarios according to specific requirements, including varying network topologies, traffic patterns, and mobility models.
- **Data Visualization:** Enables visualization of simulation results to facilitate analysis and interpretation.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Installation:** Ensure you have NS3 and its Python bindings installed on your system. Refer to the NS3 documentation for installation instructions.
2. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Petitnuagedk/ns3_python_stuff.git
   ```
3. **Setup Simulation Environment:** Configure simulation parameters, including network topology, mobility model, traffic generation, and QoS metrics to be evaluated.
4. **Run Simulation:** Execute the simulation script using Python within the NS3 environment.
   ```bash
   python Ex1.py
   ```
5. **Analyzing Results:** Once the simulation completes, analyze the generated results to evaluate QoS metrics and assess network performance under various conditions.
